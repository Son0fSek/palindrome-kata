Palindrome-checker Kata
=======================

A Palindrome is a word that reads the same forwards and backwards,

e.g.
* civic
* radar
* level
* kayak

Build a palindrome checker starting with a single letter word and then increasing.

Once you can check single words, increase to palindromic phrases

e.g.
  * race car
  (or my favourite)
  * Are we not drawn onward, we few, drawn onward to new era?

Bonus! Once complete, repeat/refactor the exercise into Java 8 if not already.
